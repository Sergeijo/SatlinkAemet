# SatlinkAemet
Wpf MVVM DotNet Core App for Satlink Developer Technical Test.
- *Implemented in Net 5.0 because it has been developed in Visual Studio 2019*.
- *In the future, if the application is also intended to be implemented in a Web Front, we would create the Rest Api and inject the logic into it. In the WPF Front we would request the data from the Api with the corresponding HTTP Requests*.

## Visual Studio
Simply open the solution file <code>\Satlink\Satlink.sln</code> and build/run.
